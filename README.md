# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: MCUboot-based basic bootloader

[MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) is an open-source library enabling the development of secure bootloader applications for 32-bit MCUs. MCUboot is the primary bootloader in popular IoT operating systems such as Zephyr and Apache Mynewt. This example demonstrates using MCUboot with PSoC&trade; 6 MCUs. This example bundles two applications:

- **Bootloader app:** Implements an MCUboot-based basic bootloader application run by CM0+. The bootloader handles image authentication and upgrades. When the image is valid, the bootloader lets the CM4 CPU boot or run the image by passing the starting address of the image to it.

- **Blinky app:** Implements a simple LED blinky application run by CM4. You can build this application in one of the following ways. The application toggles the user LED at different rates depending on whether it is built-in BOOT or UPGRADE modes.

   - **BOOT mode:** The application image is built to be programmed into the primary slot. The bootloader will simply boot the application on the next reset.

   - **UPGRADE mode:** The application image is built to be programmed into the secondary slot. Based on user input bootloader will copy the image into the primary slot and boot it on the next reset.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

1. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

2. Install the Python interpreter and add it to the top of the system path in environmental variables. This This code example is tested with [Python v3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic)" application with the desired name "Psoc6Mcuboot" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic --user-app-name Psoc6Mcuboot --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/Psoc6Mcuboot" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/Psoc6Mcuboot" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

## Operation

This readme expects you to be familiar with MCUboot and its concepts. See [MCUboot documentation](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) to learn more.

This example bundles two applications - the bootloader app run by CM0+ and the blinky app run by CM4. You need to build and program the applications in the following order. Do not start building the applications yet: follow the [Step-by-step instructions](#step-by-step-instructions).

1. *Build and program the bootloader app* - On the next reset, CM0+ runs the bootloader and prints a message that no valid image has been found.

2. *Build and program the blinky app in BOOT mode (default)* - On the next reset, the bootloader will let CM4 run the blinky app from the primary slot. This application toggles the user LED at a 1-second interval.

3. *Build and program the blinky app in UPGRADE mode by setting the make variable `IMG_TYPE` to `UPGRADE`* - On the next reset, the bootloader will copy this new image from the secondary into the primary slot and let CM4 run the image from the primary slot. The application toggles the user LED at a 250-millisecond interval. You have the option to make the upgrade image permanent in the primary slot or revert to the image that is in the primary slot on reset.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Install the dependent modules for the [imgtool](https://pypi.org/project/imgtool/) Python module for image signing and key management.

   MCUboot already includes this module but not the dependent modules. Do the following:

   1. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the *\<mtb_shared>/mcuboot/\<tag>/scripts* directory.

      On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu.

      In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

   2. Run the following command to ensure the required modules are installed or present ("Requirement already satisfied:" is printed).

      ```
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
4. Update the value of the variable `PLATFORM` in the file _shared_config.mk_ in the folder _< application >/bootloader_cm0p_ according to the kit used. Currently, in the Makefile, a conditional if-else block is used to automatically select a value based on the kit selected. You can remove it and directly assign a value according to the following table.

    Kit | PLATFORM variable value
    ------ | ------
    CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT <br>CY8CKIT-062-BLE <br>CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01 <br>CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01 <br> | PSOC_062_1M
    CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br>CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br>CY8CEVAL-062S2 <br>CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br>CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br>CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br>CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 | PSOC_062_2M
    CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | PSOC_062_512K
<br>

5. Build and program the bootloader and the blinky application in the BOOT mode.

   <details open><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the 'bootloader_cm0p' application in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**. It programs both CM0 and CM4 applications.
   </details>

   <details open><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, go to _< application >/bootloader_cm0p_ and execute the `make program_proj` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile, but you can override those values manually:

      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

      After programming, the bootloader starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays a message as shown follows:

      **Figure 1. Booting with no bootable image**

      ![](images/booting-with-no-bootable-image.png)


      From the terminal, go to _< application >/blinky_cm4_ directory and execute the `make program_proj` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target.

      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

   </details>

6. After programming, the bootloader starts automatically and lets CM4 run the blinky app. Confirm that the user LED toggles at a 1-second interval and the UART terminal displays a message as follows:

    **Figure 2. Booting with the blinky app in the BOOT mode**

    ![](images/booting-with-blinky-in-boot-mode.png)

7. Build (Do **not** program) the blinky application in the UPGRADE mode.

   <details open><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the 'blinky_cm4' application in the project explorer.

      2. Edit the Makefile and update the value of the `IMG_TYPE` variable to `UPGRADE`.

      3. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **Build \<Application name>**.
   </details>

   <details open><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, go to _< application >/blinky_cm4_ directory and execute the following command to build the application using the default toolchain to the default target:

      ```
      make build_proj -j8 IMG_TYPE=UPGRADE
      ```
   </details>

8. Program the UPGRADE image using CLI or through [CYPRESS&trade; Programmer](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/programming-testing/psoc-programming-solutions/).

      <details open><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, go to _< application >/blinky_cm4_ directory and execute the following command to program the UPGRADE image using the default toolchain to the default target:

      ```
      make program_proj -j8 IMG_TYPE=UPGRADE
      ```

      </details>

      <details open><summary><b>Using CYPRESS&trade; Programmer</b></summary>

      1. Launch **CYPRESS&trade; Programmer** and select the probe or kit that you are using.

      2. Click on the **Open** icon and select the UPGRADE image hex file from *blinky_cm4/build/UPGRADE/\< BSP-NAME >/\<Build Config>* directory.

      3. If your UPGRADE image is built for an external flash, select and mark the **External Memory** checkbox.

      4. Click **Connect** and then **Program**.

      </details>

9. After programming, the bootloader starts automatically, upgrades the image by copying the image from the secondary slot into the primary slot, and lets CM4 run the blinky app. Confirm that the UART terminal displays the message as shown follows:

    **Figure 3. Booting with the blinky app in the UPGRADE mode**

    ![](images/booting-with-blinky-in-upgrade-mode.png)

10. To confirm the swap of the upgrade image from the secondary slot into the primary slot and make it the primary image, enter **Y** in the UART terminal. To revert to the original image, enter **N**. Confirm that the user LED toggles at the 250-millisecond interval.

11. In case of an upgrade, confirm that the upgrade image is booted up on the next reboot.

    **Figure 4. Booting the blinky app in the UPGRADE mode after successful SWAP operation**

    ![](images/booting-after-upgrade-swap.png)


**NOTE:** You can build the combined image for bootloader and blinky_cm4 using the `make build` CLI command in the _< application >_ directory but during the linking stage there might be an error stating multiple definitions of symbols for blinky_cm4 for `BOOT` and `UPGRADE` image. Currently, the solution to the problem has been addressed in the following code section of the _< application >/blinky_cm4/Makefile_ which ignores the build artifacts of the other `IMG_TYPE`. Ex: If `BOOT` is selected as `IMG_TYPE` then _< application >/blinky_cm4/build/UPGRADE/_ build directory artifacts will be ignored during the compilation and linking of the `BOOT` image.

```
ifeq ($(IMG_TYPE), BOOT)
CY_IGNORE+=build/UPGRADE
else
ifeq ($(IMG_TYPE), UPGRADE)
CY_IGNORE+=build/BOOT
endif
endif
```

For programming the individual builds of the bootloader and blinky app, use the `make program_proj` CLI command as mentioned in the preceding steps.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Overview

As explained at the beginning of this readme, this example bundles two applications - the bootloader and the blinky app. The blinky app is directly programmed into the flash (internal or external depending on the build parameters) to quickly evaluate the MCUboot operation.

In a real scenario, an application that can download the upgrade image over a wired or wireless communication interface writes the image into the secondary slot. For example, [mtb-example-ota-mqtt](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ota-mqtt) is implemented using the [ota](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) middleware.

The MCUboot repo in [GitHub](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/tree/v1.8.3-cypress/boot/cypress) also includes two apps - MCUbootApp and BlinkyApp - for PSoC&trade; 62 MCU devices. The functionality of this code example is the same as those apps. In this example, the bootloader app reuses a lot of source files (see *bootloader_cm0p/app.mk* for the exact list of files) from MCUbootApp.

This code example uses ModusToolbox&trade; software resources such as BSPs and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU to provide a rich development experience that aligns well with other code examples based on ModusToolbox&trade; software. **Figure 5** shows the execution flow of the bootloader app.

**Figure 5. Bootloader app flow**

![](images/bootloader-flow.jpg)


### MCUboot basics

[MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) library helps to implement secured bootloader applications for 32-bit MCUs.

MCUboot works by dividing the flash into two slots per image - primary and secondary. The first version of the application is programmed into the primary slot during production. A firmware update application running in the device receives the upgrade image over a wired or wireless (over-the-air or OTA) communication interface and places it in the secondary slot. This slot-based partition helps in read/write-protecting the primary slot from a less-privileged application.

Typically, a bootloader application executes in secured mode and is privileged to access the primary slot while a less-privileged application such as an OTA application cannot access the primary slot, but it can access the secondary slot.

MCUboot always boots from the primary slot and copies the image from the secondary slot into the primary slot when an upgrade is requested. The upgrade can be either overwrite-based or swap-based. In an overwrite-based upgrade, the image in the primary slot is lost and there is no way to roll back if the new image has an issue. In a swap-based upgrade, the images are swapped between the two slots and rollback is possible. In this case, MCUboot makes use of an additional area in the flash called the *scratch area* for reliable swapping. MCUboot for PSoC&trade; 6 MCU supports both swap-based and overwrite-based upgrades.

Each image slot contains the metadata which is used by MCUboot to determine the current state and what actions should be taken during the current boot operation. In the case of an upgrade image, the `img_ok` field is updated by the application to make the current image permanent in the primary slot. See the [image trailer](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/v1.8.3-cypress/docs/design.md#image-trailer) for more details.

MCUboot implements reset recovery and resumes the copy operation if a reset or power failure occurs in the middle. MCUboot also supports multi-image bootloading where several pairs of primary and secondary slots exist. In this case, MCUboot updates each image independently; that is, updates the image in any primary slot using the image from the corresponding secondary slot. However, MCUboot always boots from the primary slot of image 0. The image 0 application once booted can boot other images as required.


#### Swap-based upgrade for PSoC&trade; 6 MCU

There are three types of swap modes supported in MCUboot - scratch, move, and using a status partition. Only swap mode using status partition can be used with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU devices because of the hardware restriction of the large minimum flash write/erase size. The MCUboot library is designed with the minimum flash to write/erase size to be 8 bytes or less. This is to ensure that data is not lost when writing to the flash sector status so that it is a single-cycle operation ensuring the robustness of the application.

Because PSoC&trade; 6 MCU devices have a large minimum flash write/erase size, a swap using status partition has been implemented. Using this algorithm, a separate area in the internal flash is used to store swap status values and the image trailer data such as the swap size and info, boot image magic value, and the image ok field.

See the "Swap status partition description" section of the [MCUbootApp documentation](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/v1.8.3-cypress/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/MCUBootApp.md).

See [MCUboot design](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/v1.8.3-cypress/docs/design.md) documentation for details.


### Flash map/partition

**Figure 6** shows a typical flash map or partition used with MCUboot. The partitions need not be contiguous in the memory because it is possible to configure the offset and size of each partition. However, the offset and the size must be aligned to the boundary of a flash row or sector. For PSoC&trade; 6 MCUs, the size of a flash row is 512 bytes. Also, the partition can be in either the internal flash or external flash.

The memory partition is described or defined through a flash map (a JSON file, see *bootloader_cm0p/flashmap/* directory for examples). It is important that the bootloader app and the bootable app (i.e., the blinky app in this example) agree on the flash map. This example uses a shared file (*bootloader_cm0p/shared_config.mk*) between the two apps and *flashmap.mk* (autogenerated from the flashmap JSON file) so that they can use the same set of flash map parameters. See Configuring the default flash map for details.

#### Sample flash maps

Following images illustrate the flash maps provided in this example. The flashmap JSON files are located in the *bootloader_cm0p/flashmap/* directory.

#### **Customizing and selecting the flash map**

A flash map for example is selected by changing the value of the `FLASH_MAP` variable in the *bootloader_cm0p/shared_config.mk* file to the desired JSON file name.

See the [How to modify flash map](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/v1.8.3-cypress/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/MCUBootApp.md#how-to-modify-flash-map) section to understand how to customize the flash map to your needs.

Before the pre-build stage, the flashmap JSON file is automatically parsed by the *bootloader_cm0p/scripts/flashmap.py* python script to generate the following files:

   1. *flashmap.mk* and *source/cy_flash_map.h* files in the bootloader example.
   2. *flashmap.mk* file in the blinky example.

The parameters generated in the *flashmap.mk* file are used in the `DEFINES` and `LDFLAGS` variables of the application Makefile.

The structures generated in the *cy_flash_map.h* file are used by the *cy_flashmap.c* file in the MCUboot library.

### Configuring make variables

This section explains the important make variables that affect the MCUboot functionality. Some of these variables are autogenerated from the flashmap JSON file and some variables can be updated directly in the Makefile or passed along with the `make build` command.

#### **Common make variables**

These variables are common to both the bootloader and blinky apps and are configured via the *bootloader_cm0p/shared_config.mk* file.

 Variable | Default value | Description
 -------- | ------------- |------------
 `SIGN_KEY_FILE`             | cypress-test-ec-p256 | Name of the private and public key files (the same name is used for both keys) |
 `BOOTLOADER_SIZE`           | Autogenerated       | Flash size of the bootloader app run by CM0+. <br>In the linker script for the bootloader app (CM0+), the `LENGTH` of the `flash` region is set to this value.<br>In the linker script for the blinky app (CM4), the `ORIGIN` of the `flash` region is offset to this value.
 `BOOTLOADER_APP_RAM_SIZE`   | 0x20000              | RAM size of the bootloader app run by CM0+. <br>In the linker script for the bootloader app (CM0+), the `LENGTH` of the `ram` region is set to this value.<br/>In the linker script for the blinky app (CM4), the `ORIGIN` of the `ram` region is offset to this value, and the `LENGTH` of the `ram` region is calculated based on this value.
 `SLOT_SIZE`                 | Autogenerated       | Size of the primary slot and secondary slot. i.e., the flash size of the blinky app run by CM4.
 `MCUBOOT_HEADER_SIZE`       | 0x400                | Size of the MCUboot header. Must be a multiple of 1024 (see the following note).<br>Used in the following places:<br>1. In the linker script for the blinky app (CM4), the starting address of the `.text` section is offset by the MCUboot header size from the `ORIGIN` of the `flash` region. This is to leave space for the header that will be later inserted by the *imgtool* during post-build steps. <br/>2. Passed to the *imgtool* while signing the image. The *imgtool* fills the space of this size with zeroes (or 0xFF depending on internal or external flash) and then adds the actual header from the beginning of the image.
 `MAX_IMG_SECTORS`           | Autogenerated       | Maximum number of flash sectors (or rows) per image slot for which swap status is tracked in the image trailer.
 `MCUBOOT_IMAGE_NUMBER`      | Autogenerated       | The number of images supported in the case of multi-image bootloading.
 `PRIMARY_IMG_START`         | Autogenerated       | Starting address of primary slot.
 `SECONDARY_IMG_START`        | Autogenerated       | Starting address of secondary slot.


**Note:** The value of `MCUBOOT_HEADER_SIZE` must be a multiple of 1024 because the CM4 image begins immediately after the MCUboot header and it begins with the interrupt vector table. For PSoC&trade; 6 MCU, the starting address of the interrupt vector table must be 1024-bytes aligned.

`Number of bytes to be aligned to = Number of interrupt vectors x 4 bytes`

i.e., 1024 = 256 vectors x 4 bytes (32-bit address) per vector.

PSoC&trade; 6 MCU supports up to 240 external interrupts in addition to the 16 system exceptions provided by CM4. See the description of the CPUSS_CM4_VECTOR_TABLE_BASE register in [PSoC&trade; 6 registers technical reference manual](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_6_MCU_PSoC_62_Register_Technical_Reference_Manual-AdditionalTechnicalInformation-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f9480c901dd) and the description of the vector table offset register (VTOR) in Cortex&reg;-M4 (ARMv7-M) architecture technical reference manual for details.


#### **Bootloader app make variables**

These variables are configured via *bootloader_cm0p/Makefile*.

 Variable             | Default value | Description
 -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------
 `USE_OVERWRITE`              | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when scratch and status partitions are not defined in the flashmap JSON file.
 `USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH`         | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when an external flash is used for either a primary or secondary slot.
 `USE_XIP`                    | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when the primary image is placed on external memory.

<br />

#### **Blinky app make variables**

These variables are configured via *blinky_cm4/Makefile*.

 Variable       | Default value    | Description
 -------------- | -----------------| -------------
 `IMG_TYPE`        | BOOT   | Valid values: BOOT, UPGRADE<br>**BOOT:** Use when the image is built for the primary slot. The `--pad` argument is not passed to the *imgtool*. <br/>**UPGRADE:** Use when the image is built for the secondary slot.  The `--pad` argument is passed to the *imgtool*.<br>Also, the blinky app defines the LED toggle delay differently depending on whether the image is BOOT type or UPGRADE type.
 `HEADER_OFFSET`   | Auto-calculated | The starting address of the CM4 app or the offset at which the header of an image will begin. Value equal to (`SECONDARY_IMG_START` - `PRIMARY_IMG_START`).
 `USE_OVERWRITE`              | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when scratch and status partitions are not defined in the flashmap JSON file.
 `USE_EXTERNAL_FLASH`         | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when an external flash is used for either a primary or secondary slot.
 `USE_XIP`                    | Autogenerated       | Value is 1 when the primary image is placed on external memory.
 `KEY_FILE_PATH` | *../bootloader_cm0p/keys* | Path to the private key file. Used with the *imgtool* for signing the image.
 `APP_VERSION_MAJOR`<br>`APP_VERSION_MINOR`<br>`APP_VERSION_BUILD` | 1.0.0 if `IMG_TYPE=BOOT`<br>2.0.0 if `IMG_TYPE=UPGRADE` | Passed to the *imgtool* with the `-v` option in *MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD* format, while signing the image. Also available as macros to the application with the same names.

### Usage of external flash

This section provides a quick overview of external flash support with MCUboot for PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. External flash support refers to placing the primary/secondary/both slots into an external flash. This helps to increase the available internal flash for the primary slot or to support update operations on MCUs with lower internal flash sizes.

MCUboot accesses the external NOR flash using the serial memory interface (SMIF) aka 'QSPI peripheral block' in PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. The SMIF block supports interfacing with QSPI devices; most of the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU development kits include a QSPI NOR flash. For example, the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W kit includes the [S25FL512S](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-S25FL512S_512_Mb_%2864_MB%29_3.0_V_SPI_Flash_Memory-DataSheet-v19_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0ed046ae4b53), which is a 64-MB (512-Mbit) QSPI NOR flash. MCUboot for PSoC&trade; 6 MCU uses the serial flash discoverable parameter (SFDP) standard to auto-discover the flash read/write commands and other parameters. Ensure that the NOR flash on your board supports this standard. See [ExternalMemory.md](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/master/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/ExternalMemory.md) for more information on working with the external flash.

During post-build steps, the image address is relocated to begin from the external flash address using the following command:

```
arm-none-eabi-objcopy --change-addresses=HEADER_OFFSET -O ihex <input.elf> <output.hex>
```

**Note:** If you are placing more than one image in the external flash, ensure that the starting address of the images is aligned to the erase sector size of the NOR flash. For S25FL512S, the erase sector size is 256 KB (0x40000).


#### External flash programming

The programmer tool for PSoC&trade; 6 MCU (based on OpenOCD) programs the external flash with the data from the HEX file when the address of the data is 0x18000000 or higher. The programmer tool requires the configuration information (e.g., erase/read/program commands) about the external flash present on the board to be able to program the flash. This configuration is placed into the user area of the internal flash, and the address pointing to the configuration is placed into the TOC2 section of the supervisory flash (SFlash) area of the internal flash. The programmer tool understands the TOC2 structure and knows where to look for the address that points to the external flash configuration. See [PSoC&trade; 6 MCU programming specifications](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_6_Programming_Specifications-Programming+Specifications-v12_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f66d9bf5627) for more information on SFlash and TOC2.

The *mtb_shared/mcuboot/\<tag>/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/cy_serial_flash_prog.c* file defines the TOC2 structure and the *cycfg_qspi_memslot.c./h* files under *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config/GeneratedSource* hold the external flash configuration structures. These files are autogenerated from *design.cyqspi* under *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config* using the [QSPI configurator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_QSPI_Configurator_4.0_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a960a2bf5986) tool.

**Note:** Although the bootloader app uses SFDP to auto-discover the external flash configuration, a static configuration must be present in the internal flash for programming to work. It is possible to program without storing the configuration in the internal flash. However, in that case, external memory programming is limited only to the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU + NOR flash device combinations that are on the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU development kits.


### Security

**Note:** This example simply demonstrates the image-signing feature of MCUboot. It does not implement root of trust (RoT)-based secured services such as secured boot and secured storage (to securely store and retrieve the keys). You must ensure that adequate security measures are implemented in your end product. See the [PSoC&trade; 64 line of secured MCUs](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu/psoc-64) that offer those advanced security built-in features, and read this [whitepaper](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-Security_Comparison_Between_PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_and_PSoC_62_63_MCU-Whitepaper-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0fb27691270a) that compares the security features between PSoC&trade; 64 'secure' MCU and PSoC&trade; 62/63 MCUs.

MCUboot checks the image integrity with SHA256, and image authenticity with digital signature verification. Multiple signature algorithms are supported; this example enables ECDSA SECP256R1 (EC256) by default. MCUboot uses the `Mbed TLS` library for cryptography.

PSoC&trade; 6 MCU supports hardware-accelerated cryptography based on the `Mbed TLS` library via a shim layer. The  [cy-mbedtls-acceleration](https://github.com/Infineon/cy-mbedtls-acceleration) library implements this layer. Hardware-accelerated cryptography shortens the boot time by more than four times compared to the software implementation (observation results).

**Note:** In the current version of the MCUBoot library (v1.8.3-cypress), hardware crypto acceleration is not supported.

MCUboot verifies the signature of the image in the primary slot every time before booting when `MCUBOOT_VALIDATE_PRIMARY_SLOT` is defined. In addition, it verifies the signature of the image in the secondary slot before copying it to the primary slot.

This example enables image authentication by uncommenting the following lines in the *bootloader_cm0p/libs/mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUbootApp/config/mcuboot_config/mcuboot_config.h* file:

```
#define MCUBOOT_SIGN_EC256
#define NUM_ECC_BYTES (256 / 8)
.
.
.
#define MCUBOOT_VALIDATE_PRIMARY_SLOT
```

When these options are enabled, the public key is embedded within the bootloader app. The blinky app is signed using the private key during the post-build steps. The *imgtool*  Python module included in the MCUboot repository is used for signing the image.

This example includes a sample key pair under the *bootloader_cm0p/keys* directory. **You must not use this key pair in your end product.** See [Generating a key pair](#generating-a-key-pair) for generating a new key pair.


#### Generating a key pair

You can use the *imgtool* Python module to generate the keys.

1. Generate the private key:

   ```
   python imgtool.py keygen -k priv_key.pem -t ecdsa-p256
   ```

2. Extract the public key in the form of a C array:

   ```
   python imgtool.py getpub -k priv_key.pem >> pub_key.pub
   ```

### Pre- and post-build steps

#### **Bootloader app: Pre-build steps**

The pre-build steps are specified through the `PREBUILD` variable in *bootloader_cm0p/Makefile*.

1. *Initialize the Git submodules for MCUboot:* This is required because the _library manager updates_ currently do not support initializing Git submodules while cloning a repo. This step executes only if the *libs/mcuboot/ext/mbedtls* directory (a submodule) does not exist or if the content of the directory is empty.

2. *Generate the external flash configuration files:* This step generates the *cycfg_qspi_memslot.c./h* files under the *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config/GeneratedSource* directory. This step is required because QSPI is not enabled in *design.modus*. This is done to avoid initializing the QSPI block in the generated source because it is initialized in the SFDP mode by the bootloader app in *main.c*. *psoc6make* autogenerates the source files from the configurator tools only if the peripheral is enabled in *design.modus*.

**Note:** Initially the customized configuration files such as - *design.cyqspi, design.cycapsense, design.modus* are present in the folder *templates/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config* and are copied automatically from this folder to *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config* during the library updates. The build system reads all these configurations from the *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config*.

**Note:** Same for the linker files as well copied from the template folder to the bsp folder during the library updates.

#### **Blinky app: Post-build steps**

The post-build steps are specified through the `POSTBUILD` variable in *blinky_cm4/Makefile*. These steps generate the signed version of the image in HEX format using the *imgtool* Python module. The `SIGN_ARGS` variable holds the arguments passed to the *imgtool*. The final image is in HEX format so that PSoC&trade; 6 MCU programmer tools can directly program the image into the device. If you are generating the image to use with a firmware update application running on the device, you may need to convert the image into binary (BIN) format.

1. Make a copy of the *\*.hex* file into a *\*_raw.hex* file.

2. Delete the *\*.hex* file because the final signed image will be generated with the same filename so that you can directly program the file either using the `make program_proj` command or using the launch configurations in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software.

3. Relocate the address and generate a new *\*_unsigned.hex* file from the *\*.elf* file using the *arm-none-eabi-objcopy* tool.

4. Sign the image using *imgtool* and generate the *\*.hex* file.


### **Bootloader app: Custom device configuration**

Initially the customized configuration files like - *design.cyqspi, design.cycapsense, design.modus* are present in the folder *templates/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config* and are copied automatically from this folder to *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config* during the library updates. The build system reads all these configurations from the *bsps/TARGET_< BSP-NAME >/config*. The custom configuration just enables the serial communication block (SCB) in the UART mode with the alias *CYBSP_UART*. *libs/mcuboot/boot/cypress/MCUbootApp/cy_retarget_io_pdl.c* uses this block to implement redirecting printf to UART.


### Design notes

1. Both the bootloader app and the blinky app implement redirecting printf to the serial port (UART). Both apps use the same SCB (UART) block to communicate with the USB-to-UART bridge provided by KitProg3. The bootloader app runs first, initializes the UART block, prints the messages, and then boots the blinky app which then again initializes the same UART block and prints messages. There is no conflict currently because the apps do not print simultaneously.

2. HAL drivers do not support CM0+. All codes written for the bootloader app use the PDL drivers only.

3. Bootloader app does not initialize the system clocks and resources; call `init_cycfg_system()` to let CM4 initialize them.
