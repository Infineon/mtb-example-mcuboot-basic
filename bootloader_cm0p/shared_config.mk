# Name of the key file, used in two places.

#    authentication. 
# 2. Passed as a parameter to the Python module "imgtool" for signing the image
#    in the Blinky app Makefile. The path of this key file is set in the Blinky

# Flash and RAM size for MCUBoot Bootloader app run by CM0+
BOOTLOADER_APP_RAM_SIZE=0x20000

# MCUBoot header size
# Must be a multiple of 1024 because of the following reason. 
# CM4 image starts right after the header and the CM4 image begins with the
# interrupt vector table. The starting address of the table must be 1024-bytes
# aligned. See README.md for details.
# Number of bytes to be aligned to = Number of interrupt vectors x 4 bytes.
# (1024 = 256 x 4)
# 
# Header size is used in two places. 
# 1. The location of CM4 image is offset by the header size from the ORIGIN
# value specified in the linker script. 
# 2. Passed to the imgtool while signing the image. The imgtool fills the space
# of this size with zeroes and then adds the actual header from the beginning of
# the image.
