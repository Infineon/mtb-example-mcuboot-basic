# Target board/hardware (BSP).
# To change the target, it is recommended to use the Library manager
# ('make modlibs' from command line), which will also update Eclipse IDE launch
# configurations. If TARGET is manually edited, ensure TARGET_<BSP>.mtb with a
# valid URL exists in the application, run 'make getlibs' to fetch BSP contents
# and update or regenerate launch configurations for your IDE.
